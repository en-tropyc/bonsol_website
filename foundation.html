        <h1>Welcome to the Bonsol Collective! </h1>
        <p>The Bonsol Collective is a band of companies, communities, and cool humans working together to reward public goods. Below is the Foundation's vision for how the Collective will work together to build the Super Verifiable Compute Platform.</p>

        <h2>What do we need a foundation for?</h2>
        <p>The Bonsol Foundation can be seen as the non-profit legal entity of Bonsol network. Its board members are officially chosen through a token-gated democratic process where the BON token holders (House of the People) decide to remove & add new board members.</p>
        
        <p>The foundation's main purpose is to administer funds from the BON token supply - mainly for Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) and Ecosystem Funding that consists of various types of grants to developers. The members and contributors of the Foundation will receive BON tokens and potentially regular wages as payment for their time and labour.</p>

        <h2>Governance Overview</h2>
        <p>The Bonsol Collective draws heavy inspiration from the Optimism Collective - we strongly believe that we should take an experimental and agile approach to governance, relentlessly iterating towards a system which stands the test of time. We envision a world where we can build multiple networks or "subnets" that have competing governance models, and the Bonsol Collective and the public will ultimately decide what the most sustainable type of model is.</p>

        <p>The Collective's model of digital democratic governance consists of 2 houses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>House of the People - the bigger house that accounts for all token holders</li>
            <li>House of the Senate - the smaller house that accounts for a select group of individuals/entities that were voted by the People to hold a Senate seat</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Governance Houses</h2>
        
        <h3>House of the People</h3>
        <p>The House of the People is an umbrella term for every person or entity that holds the BON token. We anticipate this house to transform into a governing body for the Bonsol network's final form through a series of token-gated direct and delegated democratic processes. In the House of the People, the amount of BON tokens one holds is directly proportional to the power of their voice when it comes to decision making.</p>

        <h3>House of the Senate</h3>
        <p>The House of the Senate accounts for every person and entity that holds a senate seat. A senate seat is usually obtained through a token-gated representative democratic process - where the BON token holders from House of the People delegate their tokens to respected individuals or businesses from the web3 space to represent them in decisions that are reserved for the Senate. In the Senate house, each delegated senate member has one vote.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>RPGF / Ecosystem Funds</h2>
        <p>The Senate gets to vote and direct funds related to RPGF. We propose to use a type of quadratic funding formula to assess where RPGF funds should go. No one entity should have overwhelming control over the network, and quadratic funding is able to strike a good balance.</p>
